Phonebook Web App using Trie (JS, HTML, CSS)
🧠 Project Goal:
Build a responsive phonebook web app that stores contacts in a Trie data structure and allows fast, intuitive search (auto-suggest as you type, typo-tolerant), with the ability to add, delete, edit, and call contacts. All features are handled in pure frontend — no React, no backend.

🧩 Features to Implement:
📇 Contact Storage (Using Trie)
Store contact names and numbers in a Trie.

Trie allows:

Prefix-based search (auto-complete).

Typo-tolerant suggestions (e.g., small spelling error correction).

Start with predefined contacts hardcoded in JS.

🔍 Search
Live search bar.

As the user types, auto-suggest contacts using the Trie.

Show results in a styled dropdown or list.

➕📝🔄 CRUD Operations
Add Contact: Input name & number, inserts into Trie and displays in contact list.

Edit Contact: Click edit icon/button → prefill inputs → save changes.

Delete Contact: Remove contact from list and Trie.

Data can be stored in-memory (no need for backend or localStorage).

📞 Call Simulation
When a user clicks on a contact, show a popup modal:

Display name, number.

Show “📞 Calling...” animation.

After 10–20 seconds, show “❌ Call ended” or allow user to manually end call.

Can be a fun, animated modal/dialog.

🎨 User Interface (HTML/CSS/JS Only)
Clean, modern UI (use CSS transitions, modals, icons, etc.).

Contact list UI like a real phone contact list.

Responsive for mobile and desktop.

Buttons for add/edit/delete.

Optionally use icon libraries like Font Awesome or Boxicons.

🔧 Bonus Features (Optional)
Local storage save/load contacts.

Search with fuzzy match (edit distance).

Dark/light theme toggle.

Call log history.

🧑‍💻 Suggested Workflow:
Implement and test the Trie in script.js.

Build the HTML skeleton (search bar, contact list, buttons).

Add CSS for layout and animations (popup, list transitions).

Connect JS to HTML/CSS for search, edit, add, delete, call.

Polish UI and add mobile responsiveness.
